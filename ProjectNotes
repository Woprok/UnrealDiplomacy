Unreal Engine Notes

Naming Conventions

Personal Dev Notes on Progress
- Learning UE is not hard after having some experience with Unity
- But learning is more complex as UE seems to expose much more on user at first glance, even tutorials are not really beginner level, more of beginner with experience in dev/gamedev.
- Naming conventions are quite intuitive and consistent, compared to Unity, which is messy
- Compiling C++ source is painful, its easy to break whole project
- Blueprints can crash quite easily whole editor
- Default configuration files, could use better documentation as internet just points you to what write, without describing why its necessary
- Blueprints are easy to use, yes you can easily make mistake with wrong condition and not even realize it.
- C++ is actually scary due even with c++ experience, I find it hard to find the right path
- Walking through MultiplayerShootout and StrategyGame helped a lot to understand how to do things
- Did I mention how I can waste day on deciding naming convention to use, even through I am just using official one ?
- Why does UE prefix new C++ classes with naming convention prefix, isnt it my job ? Now I need to rename bunch  of classes as I want name of class to be equal to name of file, prefix included...
- Multiplayer should work out of box which is great, but understanding what is necessary for it to work correctly gave me headache
- I gave up on SlateUi without even trying, like that thing is super complicated compared to blueprints, even if its super usefull.
- Replication is not simple as it looks. Anytime client joins via JoinSession, server will invoke OnPostLogin. But it does not mean that Client is synchronized as RPC calls will not affect it as one might want.
- Replicating correctly on newly joined client can be done via BeginPlay on PlayerState or others that will be replicated.
