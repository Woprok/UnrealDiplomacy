Game Design:

-> TURN-Based Gameplay
- Each PLAYER takes turn in order.
- During TURN PLAYER executes actions.
- We distinguish two types of actions:
--> Self-Affecting Actions
-- Basically economic, base-building actions etc. 
--> Other-Affecting Actions
-- Any direct or indirect action that affects other PLAYERS or other PLAYERS TERRITORIES.

-> TURN
- Dunno it just represents unit of time, like a week/month/year depending on how we want to scale it.
- NOTE: It would be perfect if we could go Real-Time with Pause but that is not feasable in time we can allocate for this.

-> Maximum and minimum of allowed PLAYERS
- Due to fact that we are looking for TURN-Based gameplay, we can't have too many players.
- Due to diplomacy condition, we need reasonable count of opponents to force stalemates.
- We can limit player count to something like 16 - 32, which is also reasonable range for solid diplomacy.

-> PLAYER is NATION
-> NATION is combination of TERRITORIES and NATION IDENTITY

-> TERRITORIES
- Each TERRITORY is represented as an HEX TILE.
- TERRITORIES are generated during MAP GENERATION and their count does not change.

-> MAP GENERATION
- Done in multiple steps:
--> Generate Total HEX TILE Count 
- Based on amount of Players, each player should have SAFE AREA and that has to reflect in total count.
--> Generate PLAYER positions
- With respect to SAFE AREA required
--> Generate Resources

-> MAP
- Collection of HEX TILES
- Might or might not indicate existance of MINIMAP, it's optional feature that would be nice to have. (optional feature)

-> MINIMAP
- Optional, as it provides lot of filters etc. that can help player to navigate to correct action.

-> HEX TILE
- Has RESOURCE
- Has FEATURE
- Has TYPE
- Has OWNER
- Creates INFORMATIONS every TURN

-> OWNER
- Is either a PLAYER or GAIA/NATURE.

-> GAIA/NATURE
- Is PLAYER 0, that never makes any action during his turn ?
- Basically just controls WORLD.

-> WORLD
- :COOL:

-> SAFE AREA
- Specific area around PLAYER starting CAPITAL TERRITORY.
- One unit of distance from CAPITAL TERRITORY all MANDATORIES TERRITORIES must spawn.
- Two unit of distance anything can appear but no other PLAYER SAFE AREA.

-> MANDATORIES TERRITORIES
- Contains specific HEX TILE FEATURES.

-> NATION IDENTITY
- Each nation has set of BONUSES and FLAWS.
- They encourage certain behaviour that favors specific playstyle.
- Due to diversity in NATION IDENTITIES it can cause inbalance, but should always encourage DIPLOMACY
- NATION IDENTITIES do not have to be on same level, we can distinguish less and more advanced... (optional feature)

-> DIPLOMACY
- Used very loosely in this document. Replace by any suitable words that carry the spirit of DIPLOMACY.

-> RESOURCE
- Two types of RESOURCE:
--> SIMPLE RESOURCE
- Can be traded 1:X, works like TRADE CONTRACT.
- We will start with 3 SIMPLE RESOURCES: FOOD, WOOD, GOLD
--> LUXURIOUS RESOURCE
- Can be traded, which creates TRADE CONTRACT that provides LUXURIOUS RESOURCE to another PLAYER for specific amount of TURNS.
- Original owner keeps LUXURIOUS RESOURCE as well, making it benefitial and encouraging to trade.
- Bonus from LUXURIOUS RESOURCE increases for each ongoing trade for owner
- LUXURIOUS RESOUCE can be varied to create content illusion ? but they will all behave same.

-> FOOD
- Resource primarily used for economy (PEACE)
-> WOOD
- Resource primarily used for construction (NEUTRAL)
-> GOLD
- Resource primarily used for military (WAR)

-> TILE TYPE
- Different TILE TYPE can provide different BONUS to it YIELD.
- We will consider following types: WATER, LAND

-> TILE FEATURE
- Different TILE FEATURE can provide different BONUS to it YIELD.
- We will consider following feature: UNDERGROUND, SKYLANDS

-> NATION BONUSES
- In general bonus to something in easy to quantify and imagine number so either numerically big value or percentual increase.
-> NATION FLAWS
- In general penalty to something in easy to quantify and imagine number so either numerically big value or percentual increase.
- Preferably flaw should always come with cool bonus.

-> HEX TILE IMPROVEMENT
- Each tile can be improved:
- Upgrades: FOOD, WOOD, GOLD can be upgraded to increase YIELD
- Special upgrades are always available: PEACE, NEUTRAL, WAR (Bonuses & Penalties will be done later as we achieve something).
- Special upgrades are expected to help PLAYER to even to other or get supperiority over other in certain area like war.

-> INFORMATIONS
- Each PLAYER ACTION should be representable as INFORMATION and with this it should be possible to later create at least a little functional espionage system.

QUESTIONS:
MP yes or no ? like there is very little to no reason not to. If everything behaves like MP due to turn nature?
