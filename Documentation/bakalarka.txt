TUTORIAL AS TIME TRAVELING EXPERIENCE, SEE DARK FUTURE CAN YOU AVOID IT ?


- X size of Action Deck, that each player has
-> provides unique option for each player
--> additional layer of strategy
--> allows shorter games as player options are more limited
--> allows more interesting mechanics that you might or might not play with
---> e.g. tech actions, magic actions, dimension actions, etc...
-> limites player ability to play tradition 4X, but do we want it to be like that ?
-> is it good for diplomacy ? is pressure of limited turns and actions available going to force more
pacifistic approach or will war actions overshadow talk & spy action ?

Goals:
-> Players needs to be incentivized to play both War & Diplo path (or any other, creating archetypes for play)
-> War path is straightforward map painting game, but is dangerous as diplo trivially counters it.
-> Diplo path is more complex strategy that needs to do various things to gain advantage.
-> Spy path si about sabotaging everything your opponents do, creating confusion at the final reveal ?
-> Economic path is optimization strategy, thus requires access to multiple actions and thus utilize diplo.
-> Tech & other paths are about creating combos ?

As a result we have rock-paper-scissor way of playing the game, that is easy to understand:
Spy > Diplo > War > Spy
(Explenation: Spy makes diplomacy unreliable, Diplomacy prevents war action to be beneficial, War liquidates lies)
Economic, Technology, Cultural, Magic etc. are interferences into base formula.
Allowing alternative ways to achieve goal and victory points.

Various ways of play, each playstyle is valid: Warmonger, Jew/Magnate, Peacemaker, Techsupremacy, Magicsupremacy, Mixed...

Bad things:
-> limites players
-> creates meta strategies
-> requires lot of actions etc... to work well
-> can reduce complexity, but also increase it
-> makes game more competetive oriented, thus MP focused
-> reduces city building element to a certain degree
-> is something that can't be continued to called 4X game / standard turn based strategy
-> snap mechanic as rising stakes, might not work well ? kinda requires motivation to be there
if player is confident in winning or being in upper half of rank to get bonus, others might retreat to often ?
(joke on that, snap players are bad at it, DENIED as valid argument)

Actions:
-> Trade
-> Ally
-> Border Access
-> Rival
-> Exploit (for each resource?)
-> Many more actions that are specific for tile/circumstance
-> Actions that affect Sea/Mountains/Underground/Land/Sky only ?
... expected count 30+

GAME-LOOP:
1. Players select Action Deck Size (6 - all)
-> Deck Size defines length of the game (turn count)
-> Deck Size defines amount of available actions per turn
-> Deck Size defines maximum map size (technically, it's limited by available actions per turn)
2. Players select/create their own Action Deck
3. Game is being prepared before the play:
-> Map is generated
-> AI & Players Capitals are placed on the map
-> AI is full player (based on decks we can limit them)
4. Game Starts
-> Based on join order, each player gets assigned turn priority
-> Turn priority can be recalculated based on current score lead

ACTION DECKS:
-> Contains few ACTIONS. (Determined by the MAP & PLAYER COUNT or GAME MODE/FORMAT)
-> ACTIONS are either GENERIC, LAND, WATER, UNDERGROUND, SKY based.
-> GENERIC ACTIONS are core of the DECK.
-> LAND, WATER, UNDERGROUND, SKY are SPECIAL ACTIONS, that are enabled based on MAP.
-> SPECIAL ACTIONS are not counting toward the count, they are just single/lobby-set slot count.

ACTIONS RESOLUTION:
-> PLAYERS choose their ACTIONS.
-> BASED on TURN PRIORITY all ACTIONS are resolved.
-> CONFLICTING ACTIONS are either resolved in TURN PRIORITY order or NEGATE each other.

TURN PRIORITY RESOLUTION:
-> INITIALLY based on JOIN ORDER of PLAYERS.
-> PLAYERS that used STAKES are moved to front, in order of the STAKES call.
-> PLAYERS can be reordered based on used ACTIONS or CURRENT VICTORY APPROACH STATE.

VICTORY & LOSS:
-> Only one NATION can win.
-> NATION can be composed of multiple PLAYERS.
-> NATION can't be composed of more then half of all PLAYERS in the LOBBY (EXPECTS 8, so 4 is MAX)
--> Technically it could be, but the STAKES MECHANIC will not work, it would have to resolve to give only base amount points.

RANK SYSTEM & POINTS: (#just_copy_the_snap)
-> PLAYERS receives 2 POINTS for VICTORY and loses 2 point on LOSS.
-> PLAYERS loses 2 POINTS on RETREAT.
-> STAKES doubles the POINTS investment for all participating PLAYERS, starting next TURN.

STAKES MECHANIC:
-> PLAYERS can raise STAKES and declare himself candidate for VICTORY.
-> STAKES increase the amount of RANK POINTS won or loss at the end of the game.
-> REQUIRES MMR and MULTIPLAYER. Irrelevant for unreleased game, but can be interesting as PROOF OF CONCEPT.
-> ADVANTAGES:
--> Can be used for a BLUFF.
--> Makes each game matter more and loosing doesn't feel so bad.
--> It's possible for half of PLAYERS to win, thus encourages more cooperative approach.
-> DISADVANTAGES:
--> Copy of other game mechanic, might not work well in the end...

GAME-STORY:
-> It happened at the new year eve all around the world. Mysterious entity appeared in the sky's and claimed
that it will end all but one nation in the world, the one that he would deem worthy of living on. Thus he gave all
rulers one year to prove their nation worth. Can you use remaining resources and wits available to you and become
the one who will prevail in this situation ? Will you try to find another way to survive ? How low are you willing to
go to be the last standing ?

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
-> PLAYERS can choose different paths to get VICTORY.
-> STANDARD VICTORY is to be most worthy NATION at the end of the GAME.
-> Or fullfil any other VICTORY CONDITIONS.
--> DOMINATION VICTORY by controlling more then HALF/TWO-THIRDS of the MAP.
--> DIPLOMATIC VICTORY by forming most powerful ALLIANCE.
--> ESPIONAGE VICTORY by completely controlling flow of INFORMATIONS in the WORLD and knowing the complete TRUTH.

WAYS OF PLAY:
-> WARFARE is classic straightforward military/domination.
-> ESPIONAGE is sneaky way of play using all tricks in the book. Obscuring the real truth.
-> DIPLOMATIC is way of persuading other PLAYERS to slowly get advantage over them.
-> GENERALIST is approach by combining everything in less focused way.
-> SPECIALIST is enabled by using special mechanics, like TECHNOLOGY, CULTURE, MAGIC...
